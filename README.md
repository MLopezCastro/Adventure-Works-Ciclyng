A case study involving data bases, improving data quality, creating relational data models, using DAX and designing reports with Power BI

Data Cleaning: 
For this project, I had to improve the quality of our data through effective cleaning. I tackled missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies, ensuring that our analysis would be based on reliable data.

Relational Data Model Creation: 
Next, I designed a relational data model tailored to our business needs. By defining primary keys, foreign keys, and establishing relationships, I ensured efficient data storage and retrieval.

DAX Metrics Calculation: 
Leveraging DAX, I calculated key metrics crucial for decision-making. Functions like SUMX, AVERAGEX, and FILTER were my allies in this endeavor.

Informative Reports Design: 
Lastly, I crafted visually appealing reports. These werenâ€™t just eye candy; they provided valuable insights. Users could interact with filters, explore trends, and understand the data effortlessly.
