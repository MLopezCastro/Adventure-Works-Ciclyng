<p>A case study involving databases, improving data quality, creating relational data models, using DAX, and designing reports with Power BI.</p>

<h2>Data Cleaning:</h2>
<p>For this project, I had to improve the quality of our data through effective cleaning. I tackled missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies, ensuring that our analysis would be based on reliable data.</p>

<h2>Relational Data Model Creation:</h2>
<p>Next, I designed a relational data model tailored to our business needs. By defining primary keys, foreign keys, and establishing relationships, I ensured efficient data storage and retrieval.</p>

<h2>DAX Metrics Calculation:</h2>
<p>Leveraging DAX, I calculated key metrics crucial for decision-making. Functions like SUMX, AVERAGEX, and FILTER were my allies in this endeavor.</p>

<h2>Informative Reports Design:</h2>
<p>Lastly, I crafted visually appealing reports. These werenâ€™t just eye candy; they provided valuable insights. Users could interact with filters, explore trends, and understand the data effortlessly.</p>
